The Performance Section of the Brazilian Department of Airspace Control
and the Performance Review Unit of EUROCONTROL jointly developed this
third edition of the Brazil-Europe comparison of Air Navigation System
Performance. This edition of the bi-regional report builds on the
previous comparison reports using commonly agreed metrics and
definitions to compare, understand, and improve the performance of air
navigation services. This report and previous editions are available at

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \url{https://ansperformance.eu/global/brazil} or
\item
  \url{https://performance.decea.mil.br/}.
\end{itemize}

This report updates the earlier editions and assessment of the
operational air navigation system performance in both regions, Brazil
and Europe, extending the time frame and incorporating additional
analyses. This edition focuses on a subset of the eleven Key Performance
Areas identified by the ICAO Global Air Navigation Plan, in particular
Predictability, Capacity and Efficiency.

this edition}

\end{figure}

The comparison shows similarities and differences in the air navigation
service provision and observed performance in both regions. Major
take-aways of this report include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The close collaboration between DECEA and EUROCONTROL is highlighted
  sharing insights and experiences with the international aviation
  communities, thus assisting in advancing ATM performance management
  worldwide.
\item
  Brazil saw a rise in the ATCOs number, whereas Europe observed a
  considerable decrease, highlighting a substantial contrast in the
  systems' responsiveness to the challenges of COVID/re-emerging demand
  for air traffic.
\item
  In 2022/2023, the commercial flight distribution reveals that a
  smaller number of airports manage 80\% of commercial takeoffs, with
  Brazil showing a slightly greater concentration compared to Europe.
\item
  Regarding punctuality, unique trends were evident in both regions, not
  solely attributable to the extent of traffic resurgence. In Brazil, a
  consistently higher proportion of flights arrived significantly early,
  a pattern largely unaffected when comparing 2019 to 2022/2023.
  Conversely, the documented challenges of European airports in coping
  with the recovering traffic demand in 2022 highlighted the
  repercussions of their lower preparedness levels.
\item
  The recorded throughput at Brazilian airports exhibited less
  variability amid the pandemic, indicating a sustained demand
  concentration during peak operational hours. In the European context,
  innovative operational ideas present the most substantial potential
  for growth, considering the existing runway systems and associated
  capacities, which set an upper limit.
\item
  The expanded dataset for Brazil reaffirmed past patterns regarding the
  extra time spent in terminal airspace. Typically, arrival sequencing
  and limited capacity lead to extended times during the arrival phase.
  In Europe, reduced air traffic translated to less strain on arrival
  sequencing. Yet, the notable rise of the additional time from 2021 to
  2022/2023 in multiple airports implies that operational constraints
  and a higher level of sequencing resurface as demand increases.
\end{itemize}

This report will be updated throughout the coming years under the
umbrella of the DECEA-EUROCONTROL memorandum of cooperation. It is also
planned to establish a web-based rolling monitoring updated on a regular
basis.

Future editions will complement the data time series and support the
development of further use-case analyses. The lessons learnt of this
joint project will be coordinated with the multi-national Performance
Benchmarking Working Group and the ICAO GANP Study sub-group concerned
with the further development of the GANP Key Performance Indicators.

\section{Background}\label{background}}

Air transportation is a key economic driver in Brazil and Europe. Both
regions share the political goal of a performance-based approach to
foster the continual growth and efficiency of air transport. It is
recognised that Air Navigation Services (ANS) play a critical role in
terms of limiting the constraints on airspace user operations.
Accordingly, the analysis and regional comparison of operational ANS
performance informs about trends over time, the success of change
implementation, and potential performance benefit pools for future
exploitation.

With a view to a tigher collaboration between Brazil and Europe, DECEA
and EUROCONTROL signed a cooperation agreement in 2015. This agreement
encompasses various activities, most notably cooperation and joint
initiatives in the domain of operational performance benchmarking of
ANS.

The close technical collaboration of the Performance Section of DECEA
and EUROCONTROL's Performance Review Unit comprises the further
development and validation of proposed ICAO GANP indicators, regular
performance related data exchange, and the production of regional or
multi-regional performance reports. An essential part of this work
entails the identification and validation of comparable data sources,
the development of a joint data prepartory process, and supporting
analyses to produce this report or contribute to the aforementioned
international activities.\\
This report represents the third edition of joint comparisons between
Brazil and Europe.

\hypertarget{performance-areas}{%
\section{Performance Areas}\label{performance-areas}}

Establishing shared definitions and a mutual understanding is essential
to facilitate comparisons and operational benchmarking activities.
Therefore, the groundwork presented in this report is rooted in commonly
accepted findings from prior work conducted by ICAO, other regional or
multi-regional operational benchmarking initiatives (e.g., PBWG
\footnote{The Performance Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) comprises
  participants from Brazil (DECEA), China (CAA-OSC), Japan (JCAB),
  Singapore (CAA), Thailand (AEROTHAI), United States (FAA-ATO), and
  EUROCONTROL.}), and practices within various regional or
organisational settings.

The key performance indicators (KPIs) utilised in this study have been
developed through a rigorous process that integrates the best available
data from both the DECEA Performance Section and PRU. It is important to
note that the comparative analysis outlined in this iteration of the
report does not encompass all eleven Key Performance Areas (KPA) as
presented in Figure~\ref{fig-scope-KPAs-KPIs}.

From an indicator perspective, the DECEA Performance Section and PRU
have reached a consensus to concentrate on operational benchmarking and
aligning their efforts with the performance indicators proposed by ICAO
in conjunction with the update of the Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP).
Future work may also include aspects of cost-effectiveness.

\hypertarget{geographical-scope}{%
\section{Geographical Scope}\label{geographical-scope}}

This report's geographical focus encompasses Brazil and Europe.

Airspace control in Brazil is a fully integrated civil-military
operation. The Brazilian Air Force is responsible for air defence and
air traffic control functions. Within this framework, the Department of
Airspace Control (DECEA) operates as a governmental entity under the
authority of the Brazilian Air Force Command. DECEA plays a pivotal role
by coordinating and furnishing human resources and technical equipment
to all air traffic units operating within Brazilian territory. This
collaboration ensures air traffic safety while contributing to military
defence efforts.

DECEA is the cornerstone of the Brazilian Airspace Control System
(SISCEAB). This department provides air navigation services for the vast
airspace jurisdiction covering 22 million square kilometres, including
oceanic areas. The Brazilian airspace is further divided into five
Flight Information Regions (FIR) and the areas of responsibility of
these integrated Centres for Air Defence and Air Traffic Control
(CINDACTA) are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig-BRA-airspace}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.71in,height=\textheight]{././figures/BRAZIL_CINDACTA_AND_CRCEA.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-BRA-airspace}Brazilian Airspace Structure/FIRs
(CINDACTAs)}

\end{figure}

The CINDACTAs merge civilian air traffic control with military air
defence operations. In addition to the CINDACTAs, there's the Regional
Center of Southeast Airspace Control (CRCEA-SE), tasked with managing
air traffic in the densely congested terminal areas of São Paulo and Rio
de Janeiro.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4.09in,height=\textheight]{././figures/Europe-ECTRL.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-EUR-airspace}European Airspace and EUROCONTROL
Member States}

\end{figure}

In this report, Europe, i.e.~the European airspace, is defined as the
area where the 41 EUROCONTROL member states provide air navigation
services, excluding the oceanic areas and the Canary islands (c.f.
Figure~\ref{fig-EUR-airspace}). In 2016, EUROCONTROL signed a
comprehensive agreement with Israel and Morocco. Both comprehensive
agreement States will be successively fully integrated into the working
structures of EUROCONTROL, including performance monitoring. Within this
report, these states are included in the reported network traffic
volumes.

EUROCONTROL is an inter-governmental organisation working towards a
highly harmonised European air traffic management system. In general,
air traffic services are provided by air navigation service providers
entrusted by the different EUROCONTROL member states. Dependent on the
local and national regimes, there is a mix of civil and military service
providers, and integrated service provision.\\
The Maastricht Upper Area Control Center is operated by EUROCONTROL on
behalf of 4 States (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg, and Germany). It is
the only multi-national cross-border air traffic unit in Europe at the
time being. Given the European context and airspace structure, the
European area comprises 37 ANSPs with 62 en-route centres and 16
stand-alone Approach Control Units (i.e.~totalling 78 air traffic
service units).

Europe employs a collaborative approach to manage and service airspace
and air traffic. This includes the integration of military objectives
and requirements which need to be fully coordinated within the ATM
System. A variety of coordination cells/procedures exists between civil
air traffic control centres and air defence units reflecting the local
practices. Many EUROCONTROL member states are members of NATO and have
their air defence centres / processes for civil-military coordination
aligned under the integrated NATO air defence system.

Further details on the organisation of the regional air navigation
systems in Brazil and Europe will be provided in Section 2.1.

\hypertarget{study-airports}{%
\subsection{Study Airports}\label{study-airports}}

As concerns airport-related operational air navigation performance, this
edition of the comparison report addresses the performance at a set of
selected airports. These airports represent the top-10 or most relevant
airports in terms of IFR movements in both regions and allow to make
meaningful comparisons.\\
In Brazil, the selected airports play a significant role for the
national and regional connectivity, including the major hubs for
international air traffic. These study airports have consolidated
systems and structured processes for data collection in support of this
comparison report.\\
For the European context, the study airports comprise the busiest
airports in several states exhibiting a mix of national, regional, and
international air traffic. These airports are also characterised by
varying operational constraints that make them excellent candidates for
an international comparison. All of these airports are subject to the
performance monitoring under the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System
and provide movement related data on the basis of a harmonised data
specification.

Figure~\ref{fig-scope-airports} provides an overview of the location of
the chosen study airports within both regions. The airports are also
listed in Table~\ref{tbl-scopetable}.

\hypertarget{temporal-scope}{%
\subsection{Temporal Scope}\label{temporal-scope}}

This report focuses on the period from January 2019 to December 2023.
With this report, the focus is on building a timeline with comparable
data to be augmented in future editions.

Throughout the report, summary statistics will be given with reference
to calendar years of this comparison study.

\hypertarget{data-sources}{%
\section{Data Sources}\label{data-sources}}

The nature of the performance indicator requires the collection of data
from different sources. DECEA Performance Section and PRU investigated
the comparability of the data available in both regions, including the
data pre-processes, data cleaning and aggregation, to ensure a
harmonised set of data for performance comparison purposes.

DECEA mainly uses data from the tower systems of the main airports as a
data source for performance studies. The control tower system collects
and provides data for each landing and take-off operation automatically.
This edition blended ANAC (Brazilian CAA) official and public data with
DECEA's data to increase precision for specific indicators, adding a
pre-processing phase to the data analytical work. The provided data
include such items as the times of operations, gate entry and exit, and
flight origin and destination.

Within the European context, PRU has established a variety of
performance-related data collection processes. For this report the main
sources are the European Air Traffic Flow Management System (ETFMS
\footnote{Enhanced Traffic Flow Management System}) complemented with
airport operator reported data. These sources are combined to establish
a flight-by-flight record. This ensures consistent data for arrivals and
departures at the chosen study airports. The data is collected on a
monthly basis and typically processed for the regular performance
reporting under the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System and the Single
European Sky Performance and Charging Scheme (EUROCONTROL 2019).

\hypertarget{air-navigation-system-characterisation}{%
\chapter{Air Navigation System
Characterisation}\label{air-navigation-system-characterisation}}

This section presents key characteristics of the air navigation systems
of Brazil and Europe. In broad strokes, the provision of air navigation
services in both regions relies on similar operational concepts,
procedures, and supporting technology. Nonetheless, there are several
distinctions between the two systems, which help to account for the
similarities and differences in key performance indicators documented in
this report.

One of the major difference between the air navigation systems of Brazil
and Europe is the respective organisational structure. In Brazil, a
single entity serves as the primary air navigation services provider,
i.e.~the Department of Airspace Control (DECEA). In contrast, in Europe,
each member state has delegated the responsibility for service provision
to either national or local providers.

DECEA holds the vital role of overseeing all activities related to the
safety and efficiency of Brazilian airspace control. Its mission
encompasses the management and control of all air traffic within the
sovereign Brazilian airspace, with a significant emphasis on
contributing to national defence efforts. To achieve this, DECEA
operates a comprehensive and fully integrated civil-military system.

In 2021, a public company, NAV Brasil, was created to take over some
facilities that were linked to an old airport infrastructure provider
company in Brazil (INFRAERO). Today, this company has 1698 employees in
44 different units, providing aerodrome control services, nonradar
approach, meteorology and aeronautical information for these locations.
Despite having important numbers, Nav Brasil does not plan to establish
radar facilities or provide en-route services.

The Brazilian airspace, covering an area of approximately 22 million
square kilometres (8.5 million square nautical miles of non-oceanic
airspace), is divided into five Flight Information Regions. These
regions are further subdivided and managed by five Area Control Centers
(ACC), 57 Tower facilities (TWR), 42 Approach Units (APP) and 84
AFIS/Remote-AFIS.

The non-oceanic airspace in Europe covers an area of 11.5 million square
kilometres. When it comes to the provision of air traffic services, the
European approach involves a multitude of service providers, with 37
distinct en-route Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), each
responsible for different geographical regions. These services are
primarily organised along state boundaries and FIR (Flight Information
Region) borders, with limited cross-border agreements in place between
adjacent airspaces and air traffic service units.

A noteworthy exception to this predominantly national approach is the
Maastricht Upper Area Control (UAC), which represents a unique
multinational collaboration offering air traffic services in the upper
airspace of northern Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

Civil-military integration levels across European countries vary. Within
the European context, the central coordination of Air Traffic Flow
Management (ATFM) and Airspace Management (ASM) is facilitated by the
Network Manager. The design of airspace and related procedures is no
longer developed and implemented in isolation in Europe. Inefficiencies
in the design and utilisation of the air route network are recognised as
contributing factors to flight inefficiencies in the region. Therefore,
as part of the European Union's Single European Sky initiative, the
Network Manager is tasked with developing an integrated European Route
Network Design. This is achieved through a Collaborative Decision-Making
(CDM) process involving all stakeholders.

Another critical responsibility of the Network Manager is to ensure that
air traffic flows do not exceed the safe handling capacity of air
traffic service units while optimising available capacity. To accomplish
this, the Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC) continuously monitors
the air traffic situation and proposes flow management measures through
the CDM process in coordination with the respective local authorities.
This coordination typically occurs with the local Flow Management
Positions (FMP) within the respective area control centres.
Subsequently, the NMOC implements the relevant flow management
initiatives as requested by the authorities or FMPs.

\hypertarget{high-level-system-comparison}{%
\section{High Level System
Comparison}\label{high-level-system-comparison}}

\textbf{?@tbl-HLC2022} summarises the key characteristics of the
Brazilian and European air navigation system for 2023. Comparing the
high-level numbers, Brazil utilised an increased number of Air Traffic
Controllers (ATCOs) even during the pandemic period. In contrast, the
European system showed a reduction of total ATCOs in service. The
different behaviour suggests a difference in work force flexibility
between the systems. This may be partly explained by the fact that DECEA
shares part of the structure used in basic training with other Air Force
training processes. This leads to a more centralised and rigid process,
in which abrupt reactions in hiring planning are unwanted due to the
lengthy process of calling for candidates according to Brazilian laws
related to public service jobs. In Europe, there exists a mix of
organisational models and labour contracts ranging from public service
to fully commercial organisation. En gros, European providers were able
to react to the lower demand levels by delaying/stopping
recruitment/training and offering early retirement packages.

\begin{table}

\caption{\textbf{?(caption)}}\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}

{\centering 

\raisebox{-\height}{

\includegraphics{././figures/HLC-table.png}

}

}

\end{minipage}%

\end{table}

Another key difference affecting performance in both regions for this
report is the development of air traffic demand. Unlike in Europe, it is
interesting to note that Brazil ended 2022 already servicing air traffic
movements above the pre-pandemic (i.e.~2019) level. However, as will be
shown later, much of this growth was due to the strong increase in
general aviation and only to a lower extent in commercial aviation.\\
Overall, the volume of air traffic also rebounded in Europe. At the end
of 2023, the level reached about 90\% of the pre-pandemc air traffic (vs
about 85\% in 2022).

Both regions operate with similar operational concepts, procedures and
supporting technology. Yet, Brazil, with lower traffic density related
to airspace use, finds probably a more challenging cost-benefit ratio to
maintain communication coverage and surveillance for regions with
low-traffic. In comparison, the European region faces more considerable
challenges in coordinating efforts to adress operational constraints and
service the current demand.

2022}

\end{figure}

This report launched a first analysis of the systems' network
utilisation, taking advantage of the rich experience in comparing two
regional aviation systems. Aviation infrastructure is always expensive
and complex to maintain, including cost for the provision of air
navigation services. The analysis of the facilities' locations
distribution for this service has always basically accompanied the
distribution of airports in a region. Recently, technological
feasibility modified this logic with the possibility of remote services
and still with the possibility of joining more than one remote
installation to provide services to several locations simultaneously.

Still, a closer look at the dynamics of these routes and potential
connectivity between sites may indicate the potential for capacity to be
exploited by the aviation community or that idle capacity is installed
without reasonable prospects for use.

In Figure~\ref{fig-Apt-Rank-Comparison2022}, we see the distribution of
commercial departures for 2022 in both regions. Note that the
concentration is proportionally slightly higher on the Brazilian side,
with less than 50 airports handlinging 80\% of the commercial take-offs
that year. In comparison, the European system distributed the same
percentage over approximately 100 airports.\\
For both regions, the aforementioned share of air traffic is centralised
in a small subset of airports. On the other hand, the cumulative charts
in Figure~\ref{fig-Apt-Rank-Comparison2022} show that a high number of
airports service under 1\% of the regional air traffic volume. In both
systems, this represents more than half of the airports that serve
commercial flights. In Europe, approximately 486 airports handle only
1\% of the movements, while in Brazil, there are 210 for the same
percentage.\\
Despite being an already historically established distribution and
somewhat expected, the aviation sector agents must revisit this data
constantly to verify the use of deployed resources and capacity. There
is scope for further assessing the service provision at smaller
operations with a view to accommodate demand and capacity.

Analysing the part of ANS, specifically on the Brazilian side, the
proportion of flights using AFIS aerodromes in this sample is 10.73\%.
Among them, the busiest airport serviced approximately 4146 commercial
departures in 2022 while only 124 were handled at the least busy AFIS
aerodrome. In most cases, these operations represent remote airports
where aviation is deemed needed to give access to that community. For
the European data, a similar pattern is expected. The current data does
not allow for a labelling of all aerodromes in terms of ATS service
provision (in particular, the identification of AFIS-only services).

Future work may highlight to what extent also resources within the
European context are bound to establishing basic connectivity. Further
research can explore how both regions can maximise installed capacity,
benefit from novel operational or technical concepts, and suggest
improvements for ANS provision.

\hypertarget{regional-approach-to-operational-performance-monitoring}{%
\section{Regional Approach to Operational Performance
Monitoring}\label{regional-approach-to-operational-performance-monitoring}}

The previous report detailed the historic setup of the performance
monitoring systems in Brazil and Europe.

The implementation of the performance-based approach is not a
fundamental new activity in Europe. The Performance Review Commission
(PRC) was established within EUROCONTROL in 1998 aiming to establish and
implement an independent European air traffic management (ATM)
performance review capability in response to the European Civil Aviation
Conference (ECAC) Institutional Strategy. The main goal of the PRC is to
offer impartial advice on pan-European ATM performance to EUROCONTROL's
governing bodies. Supported by the Performance Review Unit (PRU), the
PRC conducts extensive research, data analysis, and consultations to
provide objective insights and recommendations. EUROCONTROL's
performance review system, a pioneering initiative in the late 1990s,
has influenced broader forums like ICAO's global performance approach
and the Single European Sky (SES) performance scheme. Collaborating
internationally, particularly with ICAO, the PRC aims to harmonise air
navigation practices. The PRC produces annual reports (ACE and PRR) and
provides operational performance monitoring through various data
products and online tools. Continuous efforts are made to expand the
online reporting for stakeholders and ensure access to independent
performance data for informed decision-making.

It is noteworthy to recall that DECEA, influenced by ICAO publications,
embraced a performance-based approach, notably advancing the national
state-of-the-art in collaboration with EUROCONTROL. Beginning with the
SIRIUS Brazil Program in 2012, DECEA faced challenges defining metrics,
but made significant progress after signing a Cooperation Agreement with
EUROCONTROL in 2015. DECEA published crucial documents for ICAO's Global
Air Navigation Plan, prompting an organisational transformation and
adaptation of practices. Establishing the ATM Performance Section in
2019, akin to EUROCONTROL's PRU, DECEA accelerated the build-up of
expertise in operational performance monitoring. This culminated in the
publication of the first Brazilian ATM Performance Plan for 2022-2023.
Actively fostering an open culture of knowledge-sharing within South
America, DECEA engaged in workshops and seminars, and inviting
EUROCONTROL for collaboration.

Finally, it should be noted that the recurrent use of indicators by
EUROCONTROL and DECEA and the close technical collaboration taking place
during the analysis periods for joint conclusions enrich not only the
two regions but also have a global impact. Embracing transparency, both
agencies made indicators and databases publicly accessible, perpetuating
a culture of reciprocity and transparency for mutual advancement.
Looking for broader validation and harmonisation, the lessons learned
from this scheme are systematically shared with the multi-national
Performance Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) and the Performance Expert
Group of the ICAO GANP Study Group, which deals with the development of
GANP Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this respect, this
collaboration between both parties serves as a role model for ANS
performance management on a global level.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

While both regions operate on similar operational concepts and
technologies, there exists key characteristics and distinctions in both
regions. One of the key differences is the overall organisation of air
navigation services. Brazil's air navigation services are centralised
under DECEA, overseeing all airspace control and contributing to
national defense. In contrast, Europe's air navigation services are
provided by multiple entities and ANSPs operating predominantly within
their national state boundaries and FIR borders.

Also remarkable is the comparison of the number of air traffic
controllers between Brazil and Europe during the pandemic. This revealed
contrasting trends. Brazil experienced an increase in ATCOs, while
Europe witnessed a notable reduction. This disparity underscores a
significant difference in the systems' responsiveness, partly attributed
to Brazil's centralised and rigid hiring process. At the same time,
European providers operate with greater independence and flexibility
enabling easier adjustments to the management of the ATCO workforce.

The distribution of commercial flights in 2022 indicates that only a
subset of airports handle 80\% of commercial take-offs. The
concentration effect is higher in Brazil than in Europe. On the other
hand, a high number of airports operating commercial flights represent
handle only a marginal share of 1\% of the movements in both systems.
This duality may inform decision-makers about potential performance
benefit pools with a view to allocate scarce ANS resources and
capabilities and ensure the proper balancing of demand and capacity.

This report documents the close collaboration between DECEA and
EUROCONTROL. The effort benefits the two regions and contributes
globally by sharing insights and lessons learned with international
aviation communities, aiding the development of ATM performance
management worldwide.

\hypertarget{traffic-characterisation}{%
\chapter{Traffic Characterisation}\label{traffic-characterisation}}

To facilitate operational comparisons, it is crucial to have a good
understanding of the level and composition of air traffic. The preceding
section provided an overview of the context and organisation of air
navigation services in Brazil and Europe. This chapter presents some air
traffic characteristics for both regions to provide a framework for the
observed operational performance in subsequent parts of the report.

\hypertarget{network-level-air-traffic}{%
\section{Network Level Air Traffic}\label{network-level-air-traffic}}

Figure~\ref{fig-annual-traffic-timeline} shows the regional traffic
development in Brazil and Europe. In both regions the unprecedented
decline in air traffic occurred in March 2020 in the aftermath of the
pandemic-declaration by the World Health Organisation. However, there is
a difference in terms of the overall recovery. The European recovery is
characterised by two waves, while a single setback is observed in Brazil
in second quarter of 2021. The European pattern demonstrates the
difficulty in the coordination of a joint policy of curbing the pandemic
and managing travel related constraints. With different states in Europe
introducing public health and travel constraints at differnt times,
intra-European traffic was affected by the piece-meal approach. Brazil -
and its policy on air transport - benefitted from single stance on
policy implementation.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./03-traffic_characterisation_files/figure-pdf/fig-annual-traffic-timeline-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-annual-traffic-timeline}Regional daily air traffic}

\end{figure}

For Brazil, it is important to remember that
Figure~\ref{fig-annual-traffic-timeline} shows the aggregated movements
per airport at the whole network level. The shown total does not
necessarily reflect the total number of flights. Another important
observation related to the data is that Brazil's number of airports
served with the TATIC tool (Tower ATC System) has increased. Despite
raising the processed total daily flight number, this difference is
mostly transparent for this study as these additional airports handle
only a small number of movements on a day-to-day basis.

The movements already surpassed the 2019 levels for the Brazilian
region, confirming some economic recovery in the market. According to
the CGNA (Brazilian Network Manager) assessment, general aviation is the
leading actor in this frame. The share of ``Light'' aircraft in the
fleet mix observed at Brazilian airports and the prevailing airline
traffic levels still below the 2019 traffic in the airlines' preferred
airports help to confirm this thesis.

In terms of total network level air traffic, the European region is
still lagging behind its pre-pandemic levels. Other analyses showed that
low-cost carriers recovered more agile than the classical mainline
carriers. The low-cost sector, thus, shows a higher numbers of
operations than pre-pandemic as their financial model allowed for a more
agile reaction in terms of staffing/crewing/servicing flights. The
higher share can also be explained by a side-effect of the national
support measures for some of the mainline carriers. These measures
included freeing slots at major hubs and the reduction of domestic /
short-haul operations. Accordingly, the European network is
characterised by a change in the level of connectivity and frequency of
services between the different airports.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./03-traffic_characterisation_files/figure-pdf/fig-annual-network-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-annual-network}Evolution of annual network traffic}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For Brazil, traffic in the first half of 2023 exceeded the
  pre-pandemic traffic level
\item
  On a network level, the continual recovery of the traffic is on-going
  in Europe.
\item
  The first half of 2023 saw traffic levels at about 90-95\% of the
  pre-pandemic network traffic and started following a classical
  \emph{seasonal} pattern. However, traffic recovery in Europe is not at
  the same level for each pre-pandemic service/connection. The recovery
  also resulted in a light modification of network connectivity. The
  Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in the closure of a significant
  portion of the airspace (about 20\%). However, the overall impact of
  the closure on air traffic - on a network level - was relatively
  small.
\end{itemize}

This high-level network perspective shows that traffic in both regions
is comparable to pre-pandemic levels. It will be interesting to observe
the further evolution and growth of air traffic.

\hypertarget{airport-level-air-traffic}{%
\section{Airport Level Air Traffic}\label{airport-level-air-traffic}}

The previous section showed the air traffic development on the network
level. As airports represent nodes in this overall network, changes to
the overall traffic situation will ripple down to the airport level.
This demand on terminal and airport air navigation services forms a
substantial input to understand how the operational performance measures
in this report developed over time for the selected study airports. This
reports looks in particular at the performance levels observed at 10 key
airports in each region (c.f. scope)

}

\caption{\label{fig-eur-apt-level-tfc}Europeaan airport level traffic}

\end{figure}

Analyzing the movement of the leading Brazilian airports, it is evident
that they were not responsible for the return to 2019 levels,
considering that only Campinas - SBKP and Santos Dumont - SBRJ slightly
exceeded 2019 levels. This phenomenon can be explained by the greater
difficulty of airlines in resuming activity in contrast to
general/business aviation. This last share is an essential component of
the Brazilian air movement but is a rare user of main airports.

}

\caption{\label{fig-apt-annual-change}Annual traffic at study airports
in 2022 and variation 2022/2019}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-apt-annual-change} shows the annual change of the
traffic served at the study airports in 2022 and the associated change
of the traffic levels comparing 2022 and 2019.

With Campinas (SBKP) and Rio de Janeiro (SBRJ), there are two study
airports in Brazil that serviced a higher level of traffic in 2022 than
in 2019. Both airports are key nodes for the domestic traffic in Brazil.
Salvador (SBSV) ranged at the pre-pandemic level. The other Brazilian
airports have seen - on average - a decrease of 10-20\% of traffic. This
suggests that the observed network level increase in movements is
distributed across the Brazilian network and not focussed on the
airports covered in this study.

The European airport level traffic - on average - ranged at 20\% below
the pre-pandemic levels. Munich (EDDM) and Rome (LIRF) observed higher
reductions. With an overall weaker recovery of the air traffic demand
across Europe in 2022, a similar pattern emerged. The increased network
level traffic (ranging about 10\% under the pre-pandemic level) is
distributed across the European network and other aerodrome connections.

\hypertarget{peak-day-traffic}{%
\section{Peak Day Traffic}\label{peak-day-traffic}}

While the annual traffic provides insights in the total air traffic
volume and the associated demand, it does not provide insights on the
upper bound of achievable daily movement numbers. The latter depends on
demand, operational procedures and/or associated constraints, and the
use of the runway system infrastructure. The peak day traffic is
determined as the 99th percentile of the total number of daily movements
(arrivals and departures). The measure represents thus an upper bound
for comparison purposes.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./03-traffic_characterisation_files/figure-pdf/fig-peak-day-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-peak-day}Airport peak daily traffic (2023)}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-peak-day} shows the peak day traffic in 2022 for the
study airports with reference to the number of runways. A varied picture
can be seen for Europe. For European with more than 2 runways it needs
to be noted that the runway system does not support independent
operations of all available runways. Thus, the serviced peak traffic is
also impacted by the runway system configuration.

The measure signals the use of the available runway system.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./03-traffic_characterisation_files/figure-pdf/fig-timeline-peak-day-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-timeline-peak-day}Evolution of peak-day traffic at
study airports}

\end{figure}

The year-to-year change of the peak day traffic between 2019 and 2022 is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-timeline-peak-day}. For the European study
airports, Frankfurt (EDDF), Munich (EDDM), Paris (LFPG), and Rome (LIRF)
experienced a higher drop of the daily peak traffic in comparison to
2019. Despite the not yet fully recovered demand situation at London
Gatwick (EGKK) and Zurich (LSZH) showed a moderate reduction of the
daily peak traffic in 2022. This suggest that airports with limited
airport runway capacity managed

\hypertarget{fleet-mix}{%
\section{Fleet Mix}\label{fleet-mix}}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./03-traffic_characterisation_files/figure-pdf/fig-fleet-mix-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-fleet-mix}Fleet mix observed at the study airports
in 2023}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-fleet-mix} depicts the observed share of different wake
turbulence categories (WTC) across the study airports in 2022. In both
regions, ``medium'' aircraft types are the predominant aircraft type.
The fleet mix - and in particular the separation requirements between
the different aircraft types - is an important influencing factor for
the capacity and observed (and achievable) throughput. In general, a
larger proportions of heavy aircraft or aircraft with longer runway
occupancy times may result in lower throughput due to the required
larger wake turbulence separation or time spent on the runway. The
locally defined capacity values may therefore differ based on the
predominant fleet mix and operational characteristics, and ultimately
result in different observed peak movement numbers or influence surface
and terminal operations.

In Brazil, a significant number of ``light'' types operated in 2023. For
example Salvador (SBSV) serviced about 20\% of ``light'' types. The
major hubs, i.e. São Paulo Guarulhos (SBGR), Rio de Janeiro Galeão
(SBGL), and Campinas (SBKP) observed a share of 15-20\% of ``heavy''
aircraft. These airports serve also as destinations for international
long-haul flights.

With the exception of Zurich (LSZH), the share of ``light'' types is
negligible at the European study airport in 2023. London Heathrow
(EGLL), Paris Charles de Gaule (LFPG), and Frankfurt (EDDF) observed the
highest shares of ``heavy'' types.

Within the European region - and its multitude of national hubs - a
significant number of international long-haul flights is operated at the
chosen study airports. In Brazil, the highlighted airports, Guarulhos
(SBGR), Galeão (SBGL), and Campinas (SBKP), play a major role in terms
of international connectivity. It follows that medium and light types
are used predominantly for inter-reginal connections. Based on the
selected study airports, the underlying decentralised structure of the
European network becomes more visible. Due to the geo-political
composition, airports serving capitals or representing a main national
hub are more frequent in Europe. This is in contrast to Brazil, where
the international and heavy air traffic appears more centralised at 2-3
pre-dominant hubs.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./03-traffic_characterisation_files/figure-pdf/fig-fleetmix-timeline-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-fleetmix-timeline}Fleet mix change over time
observed at study airports}

\end{figure}

On average, Figure~\ref{fig-fleetmix-timeline} shows that the fleetmix
remained fairly stable over the years. It is interesting to observe that
the unprecedented decline in air transport during the pandemic phase did
not substantially break this pattern. This suggests that the contraction
of the traffic volume hit all segments at a similar rate \footnote{It
  must be noted that conceptually, the number of aircraft remained
  unchanged in the both regions. The higher utilisation of ``heavy''
  aircraft for logistical support appeared to have offset the lower
  number international / long-haul passenger flights. For the first six
  month of 2023, this pattern is continued}.

\hypertarget{summary-1}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-1}}

This chapter described the overall evolution of air traffic in Brazil
and Europe on the network and study airport level. Air traffic observed
an unprecedented decline in both regions in response to COVID19.
However, the recovery path in both regions differed. Overall, the
Brazilian demand recovered substantially smoother than the European. As
national governments varied in their assessments and introduction of
public health measures, including travel restrictions, intra-European
air connectivity observed several setbacks. On a network level, air
traffic in Brazil exceeded the pre-pandemic level, whereas European
traffic reaches about 5-10\% below the pre-pandemic level.

In 2023, medium aircraft types were predominant in both regions across
the studied airports. Brazil hosted proportionally more light aircraft,
notably in Salvador (SBSV). At the same time, major hubs like São Paulo
Guarulhos (SBGR) and Campinas (SBKP) handled substantial shares of heavy
aircraft. Conversely, European airports, except Zurich (LSZH), had
minimal shares of light types, with London Heathrow (EGLL), Paris
Charles de Gaule (LFPG), and Frankfurt (EDDF) witnessing higher shares
of heavy types. The European network demonstrated a decentralized
structure with numerous international long-haul flights, while Brazil's
international and heavy air traffic was centralized in 3 primary hubs.
Despite pandemic-induced declines in air transport, data suggests a
stable fleet mix, indicating a consistent impact across traffic
segments.

The overall air traffic demand situation is a key driver for the
performance of air navigation services. The observed differences may
impact - inter alia - separation and synchronisation of air traffic, and
influence the observed performance reported in the other chapters of
this report.

\bookmarksetup{startatroot}

\hypertarget{predictability}{%
\chapter{Predictability}\label{predictability}}

The preceding sections have demonstrated that both air navigation
systems exhibit unique reactions to the broader developments in air
transport. Predictability plays a crucial role in these systems,
impacting their functioning during both the strategic phase, where
airline schedules are formulated, and the operational phase, where Air
Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) and stakeholders manage the
delicate balance between demand and capacity. Enhanced predictability
stands to be advantageous for ANSPs, mainly when serving airspace users,
as it contributes to highly efficient operations, even during periods of
peak demand. This chapter focuses on arrival and departure punctuality
observed at the study airports as a driving factor for predictability.

\hypertarget{arrival-punctuality}{%
\section{Arrival Punctuality}\label{arrival-punctuality}}

Figure~\ref{fig-arrival-punc} shows the evolution of arrival punctuality
for the study airports in Brazil and Europe. When comparing both regions
in 2019 and 2023, Brazil's share of early arrivals (earlier than 15
minutes before the scheduled arrival) is significantly higher than the
same European portion. The share of early arrivals accounts for 20-25\%
across all Brazilian airports. In Europe, flights tend not to arrive
significantly earlier than their scheduled time. On average, early
arrival ranges between 8-15\% in Europe in 2019. Recent studies
conducted by the CGNA/DECEA show that air operators in Brazil declare
flight times significantly longer than observed. A similar behaviour is
also observed in Europe. Built-in buffer times help to achieve a high
``on-time-performance'' record and appeal to passengers favouring a
timely arrival performance. Furthermore, both regions have regulations
for passenger compensation in place which are triggered in the case of
arrival delays. DECEA has already established a forum with the air
operator regulator to discuss and propose solutions.

European airports saw their share of punctual flights in 2022 and 2023
decrease broadly compared to 2019, even with a more proportional
distribution than the Brazilian system. For European operators, there
were two primary factors contributing the the lower performance in these
two years. The most significant is the returning and steadily growing
demand, showing that the network of flights has little ability to absorb
the delay of one specific delayed flight. A pattern already observed
pre-pandemic and requiring to investigate how to increase capacity
across the operational aviation value chain. The knock-on effect was
amplified by local resource constraints in terms of passenger and
turn-around facilitation. The incrasing traffic demand posed challenges
at many airports in Europe. Delayed arrivals accumulated further
reactionary delay and ultimately passed the delay systematically on to
next flights. Further constraints were linked to air space and flow
restrictions resulting from the geo-political conflict surrounding the
Russian invasion in Ukraine. On average, arrival delays of 15 minutes or
more compared to the schedule ranged between 25-35\% across the Europen
study airports in 2022.

\end{figure}

On average, the share of flights arriving within -/+ 15 minutes of their
scheduled time varies wider amongst the European study airports (c.f
Figure~\ref{fig-evolution-ARR-punc}). The observed punctuality (and
associated predictability) within the Brazilian system shows a more
homogenuous pattern with a general trend towards 60\% or more over the
past two years.

\caption{\label{fig-early-vs-late-arrivals}Change of share of early and
late arrivals (2019 vs 2023)}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-early-vs-late-arrivals} compares the share of early and
late arrivals at each study airport in 2019 and 2023. From a high-level
perspective, air traffic tends to arrive well ahead of schedule in
Brazil, while Europe observes a higher share of delayed arrivals.
Guarulhos (SBGR) remained the Brazilian airport with the highest share
of early flights in 2022 (i.e.~33\%), followed by Campinas (SBKP) with
30\%. Both airports are essential hubs in the country, and anticipation
can be a consequence sought by air operators for better accommodation of
the flight network. However, for flow control, this lack of precision is
equally problematic, affecting the optimal allocation of resources for
the provision of air traffic control and flow service. In turn, Madrid
(LEMD) was the European element with the most significant share of early
arrivals (i.e.~22\%) in 2022. Pre-pandemic such a share was observed at
London Heathrow in 2019. These shares still range about 11\% lower than
the highest shares in Brazil. The distorted nature of the European
network in 2022 becomes apparent when observing the share of delayed
flights. For example services at London Gatwick (EGKK) faced a share of
39\% of delayed flights. Airport operators were identified as the major
contributors to primary delays (ground handling, staff shortage),
followed by ATFM delays. However, the aforementioned reactionary effect
was the main driver of knock-on delays (EUROCONTROL Central Office of
Delay Analysis 2023) \footnote{See CODA report at
  https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/all-causes-delays-air-transport-europe-annual-2022.}.

\caption{\label{fig-departure-punc}Evolution of departure punctuality at
study airports (2019 vs 2023)}

\end{figure}

The preceding section highlighted how the general traffic conditions in
the previous years influenced the dependability of arrival schedules. In
this section, we assess the degree of departure punctuality measured as
the difference between the scheduled (i.e.~planned) departure versus the
observed actual off-block time. Figure~\ref{fig-departure-punc} shows
the overall departure punctuality at Brazilian and European airports in
2019 compared to 2022. Despite traffic levels in 2022 still ranging
below their 2019 pre-pandemic levels, the departure punctuality in 2022
was - on average - lower than before COVID.

The difference in departure and arrival punctuality between 2023 and
2019 was significantly more pronounced for Europe indicating an
increased strain on the turnaround processes. There has been a
significant increase in poor performance days, with departure
punctuality falling below 50\% and arrival punctuality dropping below
60\%, occurring more frequently than in 2019. On the Brazilian side, the
Galeão airport (SBGL) observed the highest share of delayed departure
flights. It should be noted that the SBGL is the only airport with the
Apron Control service directly provided by the airport. Some
inefficiency in the coordination between Tower and Apron or divergence
at the indicator collection point for the location may be contributing
to the observed performance.

Departure punctuality in Brazil in 2023 reaches similar levels than in
2019 and outperformed the punctuality levels observed in Europe. It is
also notworthy, that in Brazil there is a higher share of flights
blocking off between 15 to 5 minutes before their scheduled time.
Further research may help to clarify the factors driving this
phenomenon.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-evolution-DEP-punc}Evolution of arrival punctuality
window}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-evolution-DEP-punc} shows the evolution of the departure
punctuality window within 15 minutes of the scheduled departure time. On
average, the predictability of departing traffic is higher than for the
arrival (c.f. Figure~\ref{fig-evolution-ARR-punc}). The trend at the
Brazilian study airports shows a homogeneous behaviour for the period
2019 through 2023. This included a higher departure punctuality within
15 minutes during the pandemic phase. There is also evidence that the
increasing post-pandemic levels put a strain on the departure
punctuality performance with the level of observed performance in 2023
ranging at the same levels than pre-pandemic.

On the European side, punctuality levels showed a sharp decrease
post-COVID and are driven by the system-wide disruptions in 2022 and the
ripple effects observed in 2023. For most of the European study
airports, departure predictability remained constant or improved
marginally in 2023 versus 2022. This still indicates that there exists
constraints regarding the turnaround of aircraft. While variances exist,
on average the share of departures within 15 minutes of the scheduled
departure time ranges below the pre-pandemic levels. It is noteworthy to
recall that also 2019 has seen major restrictions in the European
system.

It is planned to investigate the underlying turnaround drivers in future
editions of the comparison report.

\caption{\label{fig-early-vs-late-departures}Change of share of early

\end{figure}

The change of the share of early and late departures in 2019 and 2022 is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-early-vs-late-departures}. This presentation
highlights the earlier observations. On average, European airports
observed a higher share of delayed departures by a factor of 2-3 in
comparison to Brazil. While the picture varies, the distored nature of
the traffic in 2022 is visible in the higher share of delay departures
in 2022 in Europe in comparison to the pre-pandemic levels in 2019. This
put a strain on the schedule stability across Europe. Local issues
(e.g.~reduced facilication capacity at airports) affected air traffic
services in terms of surface movement, but also rippled into the network
affecting the sequencing of arrivals and departure traffic.

\hypertarget{summary-2}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-2}}

Arrival and departure punctuality play an important role in terms of
balancing demand and capacity. Strong distortions of the schedule will
ultimately ripple down into reactionary delay and require a higher
effort for both the arrival flow and surface movement control.
Turnaround distortions further affect the planning accuracy of air
navigation services and may lead to unwanted side-effects (e.g.~longer
sequencing and holding in the terminal airspace, passenger inconvenience
due to longer taxi-times/blocked gates).

Distinct patterns were observed in both regions that cannot only be
explained by the level of traffic recovery. On average, a higher share
of flights arrived well ahead of schedule in Brazil. This pattern is
largely unchanged when comparing 2019 and 2023.

The ripple effect of the low preparedness level of European airports to
address the returning traffic in 2022 is well documented. It also
appeared that there were prevailing resource constraints for servicing
the demand in 2023. This yielded a significant low performance in terms
of departure punctuality exceeding levels observed in Brazil by a factor
of 2-3.

Distortions of the local schedule can have knock-on effects on the air
navigation service provision, both in terms of surface movement and
arrival sequencing. More research is needed to investigate and
understand the underlying drivers and to what extent regional
connectivity influences the observed patterns.

\chapter{Capacity and Throughput}\label{capacity-and-throughput}}

Maintaining an optimal network flow necessitates a equilibrium between
airport capacity and flight demand. This section delves into assessing
capacity and throughput using various key performance indicators (KPIs)
at the airport level. Airspace users expect sufficient capacity
provision addressing the levels of demand. With higher levels of
capacity utilisation, airspace users will experience congestion and
constraints (e.g.~higher inefficiency, increased delay/lower punctuality
and predictability). However, planning and staffing for peak situations
may come at significant costs to airspace user as well. In that respect
it is essential to understand the trade-off between capacity provision
and capacity consumption (i.e.~traffic demand) as it impacts the overall
system performance. Capacity and throughput analyses are therefore
showing to what extent air navigation services are capable to
accommodate the demand. The previous sections showed the level of
overall traffic recovery in both regions. The increasing demand put
strain on the systems and local knock-on effects amplified the
uncertainty and variability of the expected traffic levels. This chapter
may therefore also highlight the flexibility of air navigation services
to accommodate such distortions of the schedule.

\hypertarget{peak-declared-capacity}{%
\section{Peak Declared Capacity}\label{peak-declared-capacity}}

Peak Declared Capacity refers to the highest movement rate (arrivals and
landings) at an airport using the most favourable runway configuration
under optimal conditions. The capacity value might be subject to local
or national decision-making processes. The indicator represents the
highest number of landings an airport can accept in a one-hour period.

In both regions, peak capacity is declared by the respective authority.
In Brazil, this function is performed by DECEA. Within the European
region, the airport peak capacity is determined on a local or national
level. The processes consider local operational constraints
(e.g.~political caps, noise quota and abatement procedures) and
infrastructure related limitations (e.g.~apron/stand availability,
passenger facilities).

Figure~\ref{fig-capsovertime} shows the evolution of the declared
capacity for the airport services in this comparison report. Throughout
the last years, no substantial change in the peak declared capacity was
observed at European airports. In Brazil, on the other hand, 2019 and
2020 showed a revised capacity declaration at most of the Brazilian
airports. In 2018 CGNA had developed a refined method for the
determination of the runway system capacity.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./05-capacity_and_throughput_files/figure-pdf/fig-capsovertime-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-capsovertime}Evolution of Declared Capacities at
study airports.}

\end{figure}

The capacity of airports (and the associated runway system) is
predominantly influenced by their infrastructure. The existence of
independent parallel runways, e.g. Brasilia (SBBR) and Munich (EDDM),
can support decisively the resulting capacity. Furthermore, operational
procedures can lead to increased in airport capacity. London Heathrow
(EGLL), in the past, and Guarulhos (SBGR) in recent years show that
changes in operational procedures can help the airport absorb
significant traffic increases or reduce the additional sequencing time
in the terminal airspace. Guarulhos, for example, benefited from the
implementation of segregated operations under VMC conditions, and
Heathrow increased its capacity through the introduction of time-based
separation on final.

In this context, Figure~\ref{fig-peak-declared-cpacity} shows the
declared peak capacity for the study airports. As observable in the case
of Amsterdam Schiphol (EHAM, 6 runways), the number of runways is not a
direct indication of the maximum capacity. For example, the two-runway
airports Brasilia (SBBR), London Heathrow (EGLL), and Munich (EDDM)
share a similar runway system layout and range above the 3-runway
systems of Barcelona (LEBL) and Zurich (LSZH). London Gatwick (EGKK) is
reknown for its maximisation of its single-runway throughput.

As mentioned above, the capacity declaration/determination process takes
into account the varying local conditions and constraints. It balances
the need to accommodate growth vs policy priorities and public
interests. A potential area for further research could be a closer
investigation of the operational concepts deployed and the variations of
the declared capacity with the local runway system characteristics.

\hypertarget{peak-arrival-throughput}{%
\section{Peak Arrival Throughput}\label{peak-arrival-throughput}}

This comparison report uses the GANP KPI to measure the peak arrival
throughput as the 95th percentile of the hourly number of landings
observed at an airport (ICAO 2019a). The measure gives an indication of
the achievable landing rates during ``busy-hours''. It is an indication
to what extent arrival traffic can be accommodated at an airport. For
congested airports, the throughput provides a measure of the effectively
realized capacity. Throughput is a measure of demand and therefore
comprises already air traffic flow or sequencing measures applied by ATM
or ATC in the en-route and terminal phase. For non-congested airports,
throughput serves as a measure of showing the level of (peak) demand at
this airport.

Figure~\ref{fig-arrival-throughput} compares the observed annual peak
arrival throughput at the study airports in Brazil and Europe. On
average, the busiest hour of the Brazilian airports under study did not
suffer a significant reduction. This signals that peak arrival demand
remained fairly constant during the pandemic. An increased arrival peak
throughput was serviced at Brasilia (SBBR), Campinas (SBKP), Rio de
Janeiro (SBRJ), and Confins (SBCF). Services at Galeão (SBGL) observed a
significant shift in the traffic pattern. The peak arrival throughput
fell sharply with the pandemic and has not yet recovered. This overall
picture is contrasted by the pandemic related drop of overall traffic at
European airports. The overall reduction resulted in significantly lower
peak hours. The recovery pattern is also visible in the peak arrival
throughput behaviour.

\hypertarget{peak-departure-throughput}{%
\section{Peak Departure Throughput}\label{peak-departure-throughput}}

In analogy to the previous section,
Figure~\ref{fig-departure-throughput} shows the peak departure
throughput. The latter is determined as the 95th percentile of the
hourly number of departures.

In Brazil, and with the exemption of Galeão, an interesting trend
emerged. On average, ``busy hour'' throughput increased in comparison to
the pre-pandemic levels. In the first chapters the overall recovery and
growth of air traffic demand in Brazil was shown. With a reasonable
lower departure delay performance, there exists a higher departure
demand.

The pattern at the European airports follows the arrival throughput
trend and on average similar values were serviced. This suggests widely
homogeneous demand patterns and iteratively recovery of air traffic
services at the European airports.

}

\caption{\label{fig-capvsthru}Comparison of declared capacity and
throughput for arrival phase.}

\end{figure}

Comparing the peak declared (arrival) capacity and throughput serviced
at the differnt airports reveals a varying picture. On average,
Figure~\ref{fig-capvsthru} evidences that the majority of the airports
do not yet observe capacity constraints. In many instances, the achieved
throughput ranges 5 to 10 flights per hour below the maximum declared
capacity. In 2023, a low utilisation was observed at Galeão (SBGL),
Brasilia (SBBR), and Rome Fiumicino (LIRF) where the spread between
capacity and throughput exceeds 15 flights per hour. It is also
noteworthy, that a subset of airport services operate at their maximum
declared capacity (e.g.~SBRJ, SBKP, LSZH). These airports are also
characterised by a combination of complexity of the aerodrome layout and
operational context. It will be interesting to study how these airports
facilitate higher levels of demand. Sao Paulo (SBSP) is the only airport
that serviced a slightly higher peak arrival rate than its declared
capacity suggests.

The analysis of the spread of the declared capacity vs achieved
throughput is useful. However, it gives now indication on how often the
demand reaches the declared capacity level.

\caption{\label{fig-bli-pli}Capacity utilisation (base load index vs
peak load index)}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-bli-pli} provides an overview of the utilisation of the
available capacity during the course of a year. In Brazil, we observe a
high utilisation of the capacity at Sao Paulo (SBSP) and Rio de Janeiro
(SBRJ) in 2023 compared to earlier years (e.g.~2022). However, it must
be noted that both aerodromes are characterised by a relatively
conservative and low capacity declaration. The major hub in Brazil, SBGR
shows a relatively high base-load-index (BLI), however rarely observed
peak loads back in 2019. The associated values for 2022 or 2023 still
range below the pre-pandemic performance. Within the European context, a
high utilisation of the available system capacity was observed for
London Heathrow, Frankfurt, and Gatwick in 2019 with a BLI above 0.8 and
the associated PLI above 0.4 (top right quadrant). It is noteworthy that
in the European region in 2023 only London Heathrow returned to similar
levels of capacity utilisation. For the majority of European airports,
the peak load index ranges relatively low. This suggests that most of
the airports operate currently concentrated short peaks or have not yet
seen a return to pre-pandemic patterns. Using a regression analysis, we
can also see a difference in the trend in Europe in comparison to
Brazil. Amongst the study airports, there is a higher share of airports
with a more peak operating hours than in Brazil. This might be related
to the overall role of the airports and underlying connectivity
structure and demand levels already described in earlier chapters.
Future work on understanding the drivers between operational concepts
and demand may reveal further characteristics of the service provision
in both systems.

\hypertarget{summary-3}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-3}}

Traffic growth in Brazil exceeds pre-pandemic levels. In Europe demand
is about to reach the pre-COVID levels. Throughout the past years the
declared capacities have not been adapted. On average the declared peak
capacities at Brazilian airports tend to be lower than in Europe. This
suggests that Brazil possesses more flexibility in accommodating the
projected future growth of traffic at its major airports. Within the
European context, novel operational concepts offer the biggest growth
potential, as the prevailing separation standards and capacities of the
runway system provide for an upper bound.

The observed throughput at Brazilian airports shows lower variability
during the pandemic period. This suggests that demand remained
concentrated during the peak operating hours. Comparing the utilisation
of the capacity on the basis of a novel indicator reveals interesting
patterns. With SBSP being one of the most constraint aerodrome
facilities, but seeing the available capacity regularly utilised across
the years and reaching pre-pandemic levels.

On average the declared arrival capacity is commensurate with the peak
traffic observed at the airports. This suggests that - at the time being
- runway system capacities are not a limiting factor for servicing
traffic in both regions. It will be interesting to study to what extent
the various operational procedures applied across the airport support or
impede the projected recovery and growth of air traffic.

\bookmarksetup{startatroot}

\hypertarget{efficiency}{%
\chapter{Efficiency}\label{efficiency}}

Operational efficiency is a critical component in assessing the
management and execution of operations. It provides insights in the
management of arrival and departure flows and the associated separation
and synchronisation activities. Inefficiencies can have an impact on
user operations in terms of delays or excessive fuel burn. In light of
the previous chapters it is therefore interesting to study how the
available capacity was utilised to service demand during the different
flight phases.

The measures reported in this comparison report are based on the
observed travel time for surface operations (i.e.~taxi-in and taxi-out)
and during the arrival phase. These travel times are compared with an
associated reference time for a group of flights showing similar
operational characteristics. The determined difference (i.e.~additional
time) measures the level of inefficiency. It must be noted that high
performance operations will still yield a certain share of measured
additional times. Operational efficiency is therefore aiming at
minimising rather than eliminating these additional times as they cannot
be zero.

\hypertarget{additional-taxi-in-time}{%
\section{Additional Taxi-In Time}\label{additional-taxi-in-time}}

The additional taxi-in time measures the travel time of an arriving
aircraft from its touchdown, i.e.~the actual landing time, to its
stand/gate position, i.e.~actual in-block time). This elapsed taxi-in
time is compared to an anticipated reference time for aircraft arriving
at the same runway and taxiing to the same (group of) stand/gate
position(s). Research showed that the taxi-times are not dependent on
the type of aircraft. The additional taxi-in time indicator provides a
measure of the management of inbound surface traffic.

This report utilises another source for the movement times at Brazilian
airports. Next to the actual taxi-times, the new data source provides
also gate/stand information. Accordingly, additional taxi-times can be
now determined on a per-gate basis. Previous studies did not support
this higher level of granularity. The reader needs therefore to bear in
mind that the reported results and trends differ from previous reports
which were based on an airport-wide aggregation. The latter may be
influenced by the predominant runway system configuration and frequently
used stand/parking positions.

\hypertarget{annual-evolution-of-additional-taxi-in-times}{%
\subsection{Annual Evolution of Additional Taxi-in
Times}\label{annual-evolution-of-additional-taxi-in-times}}

\begin{figure}[H]

}

\caption{\label{fig-txit-annual}Additional taxi-in time {[}min/arr{]}
(2019-2023)}

\end{figure}

The annual development of the average additional taxi-in times at the
study airports is depicted by Figure~\ref{fig-txit-annual}. The
indicator varies across the different airports. A threshold of 2 minutes
per arrival emerges as an upper bound for the taxi-in performance.

On average, taxi-in performance in Brazil ranged in 2022 well below this
2-minute-threshold for the majority of the airports. In general, taxi-in
performance at Brazilian airports improved over the period 2019 to
2022\footnote{While general trends are consistent with previous reports,
  the changed and improved data source provides now runway and
  stand/gate information for taxi-in operations. This allows for a more
  fine-grained analysis of the additional surface movement times.
  Accordingly, observed (and reported) taxi-in performance values differ
  from the earlier reports (which are based on airport-wide reference
  times).}. However, taxi-in performance decreased in 2023 at all
studied airports. The pandemic-related drop in surface movements and
pressure on the ground infrastructure is visible for the major hubs,
i.e.~Sao Paulo's (SBGR), Rio de Janeiro's Galeão (SBGL), Campinas
(SBKP). Taxi-in performance at Campinas remained fairly constant ranging
around 2.5 min/arr across the years with a discernible reduction in
2021. The picture at SBGL and SBGR is more varied. Taxi-in performance
improved by about 1.5 min/arr comparing the pre-pandemic year 2019 with
the performance observed in 2022. While the observed taxi-in
inefficiencies in 2023 remained stable in SBGL, an increasing trend is
observed in SBGR (which is the busiest airport in Brazil).

In Europe, the average additional taxi-in times ranged generally below
the 2-minute-threshold for most of the study airports \footnote{To
  account for the low traffic demand during the pandemic years, the
  European data builds on modulated reference times for the period 2019
  through 2022. This accounts for the high number of changed surface
  movement patterns (e.g.~different runway/gate combinations
  infrequently or not used before the pandemic). While the overall trend
  is consistent, previous reports may show differnt values for the
  observed surface movement performance.}. Amongst the European study
airports, Rome Fiumicino (LIRF) and London Heathrow (EGLL) showed
regularly higher levels of inefficiency during the taxi-in phase.
Taxi-in performance deteriorated in London Heathrow (EGLL) in 2022
ranging just under 5 minutes per arrival and exceeding the pro-COVID
performance by about 2 minutes per incoming flight. In 2023, the average
additional taxi-in improved by about 1 minute per arrival. Rome
Fiumicino observed a stable taxi-in performance ranging above 2.5
minutes per arrival. This suggests that the complexity of the aerodrome
layout requires a higher effort to deconflict arrivals from other
arrivals or taxiing departures. Taxi-in performance in 2023 dropped
further at LIRF to just under 3 minutes per arrival. Several airports in
Europe showed higher or less improved additional taxi-in times during
the pandemic years. This is related to the fact that airports closed
down portions of the infrastructure (e.g.~terminals) to account for the
lower demand in air traffic. In some cases, this resulted in less
favourable runway and gate/stand combinations. In Europe, the year 2022
is also characterised by a surge in delays due to the returning demand
for air travel. Associated ripple effects were still observed in 2023.
The lower punctuality also posed challenges for arriving traffic as
incoming flights had to be serviced to other gates/stands to deconflict
from delayed departures. The latter phenomenon shows more clearly for
the major hubs amongst the study airports.

\end{figure}

The evolution of the taxi-in times at the study airports in Brazil and
Europe is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-bra-txit-timeline} and
Figure~\ref{fig-eur-txit-timeline}. In
Figure~\ref{fig-bra-txit-timeline}, we can see that the variation of
additional taxi-in time smoothened over time on the Brazilian side. This
effect appears to be associated broadly with the beginning of the
pandemic. Despite the significant return of demand in 2022 and continual
growth in 2023, there are no significant monthly variations in the
average additional time-in across the Brazilian airports. Operations at
the larger airports, e.g.~Guarulhos (SBGR), Rio de Janeiro (SBRJ),
Brasilia (SBBR) observed a more systematic increase of the monthly
average additional taxi-in times. These trends should be monitored for
the coming period.

The observed average additional taxi-in time varies across European
airports on a monthly basis. In general, seasonality is a strong driver
for month-on-month changes, as weather or seasonal traffic demand pose
additional strains on the servicing of ground movements. To a certain
degree, the pandemic period is discernible in the charts, except for
Barcelona and Zurich, which showed a slight higher leve of taxi-in
inefficiency. Such less efficient average additional taxi-in times point
to changes in the taxi-in procedures during the pandemic. Also
noteworthy is Heathrow's behaviour, which showed an increase in its
monthly average additional taxi-in times. This may be linked to
difficulties accommodating the returning traffic. It will be interesting
to study which factors impacted the significant increase in the taxi-in
inefficiency.

\caption{\label{fig-txot-annual}Average additional taxi-out time

\end{figure}

On average, higher additional times for taxi-out are observed across all
airports (c.f. Figure~\ref{fig-txot-annual}). During the pandemic, lower
traffic demand resulted in 2020 and 2021 to a significant drop of the
average additional taxi-out times. In comparison to the addtional
taxi-in time, the taxi-out phase requires a higher level of management
of the surface movements. Departure procedures and flow control can
impact the departure queue. Comparing the observed taxi-out performance
across all study airports ( Figure~\ref{fig-txot-annual}), the interval
of two to four minutes of average additional taxi-out time can serve as
a benchmark. There is a varied picture with several airports observing
additinal taxi-out times of more than 4 minutes per departure,
e.g.~SBSP, SBRJ, SBGR in Brazil and LIRF, EGLL, and EGKK in Europe. In
many instances the higher taxi-out times in 2022 and 2023 evidence the
general increase in air traffic and the reopening of closed parts of the
aerodrome infrastructure.

Moving from the annual overview to the monthly level a more finegrained
pattern emerges. Within the Brazilian context taxi-out performance
increased during the beginning of COVID (c.f.
Figure~\ref{fig-txot-monthly}). The actual order of magnitude varies
across the airports, however a clear reaction can be observed for the
initial phase (i.e.~following the WHO pandemic declaration in March).

The reaction to the unprecedented decline in air traffic is more
prominent for European airports (c.f Figure~\ref{fig-txot-eur-monthly}).
London Heathrow (EGLL) and London Gatwick (EGKK) evidenced a strong
decline of traffic and associated additional taxi-out times following
the start of the pandemic. Strong weather influences drove the taxi-out
performance at Amsterdam Schiphol (EHAM), Munich (EDDM) and Zurich
(LSZH) in early 2021.

\caption{\label{fig-txot-txit-mapping}Mapping of additional taxi-in and
taxi-out times}

\end{figure}

This analysis builds on the previous sections.
Figure~\ref{fig-txot-txit-mapping} compares the relationship between the
taxi-in and taxi-out performance observed pre-pandemic (i.e.~2019) with
the observed performance in 2023. It also shows that on average taxi-out
operations accrued more additional time than taxi-in operations (data
points range below the dotted unit line, and as shown in the previous
sections). For most of the airports, the overall performance shows a
reduction in additional taxi-out times (i.e.~characterised by a
leftshift along the x-axis) when comparing the pre-pandemic year 2019 to
2023. A significant improvement in taxi-in performance can be obsered in
Brazil across all study airports (i.e.~decreasing trend along y-axis).
This is contrasted by the behaviour in Europe. The majority of European
airports observed no significant change in their taxi-in performance
(i.e.~no vertical trend). The noteworthy exemption is London Heathrow
(EGLL). EGLL faced a significant increase in average additional taxi-in
time in 2023 in comparison to the pre-pandemic performance level
observed in 2019. The lower performance in terms of taxi-in is observed
in Figure~\ref{fig-eur-txit-timeline} which shows a strong increase in
the second half of 2023. Figure~\ref{fig-txot-txit-mapping} also shows
that the overall taxi-performance in Europe tends to show lower levels
of variation between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. Exemptions are
London Heathrow (EGLL) and Rome Fiumincino (LIRF) that saw a discernible
rise in taxi-in inefficiencies and exceeding the levels observed at
Brazilian study airports.

\hypertarget{additional-time-in-terminal-airspace}{%
\section{Additional Time in Terminal
Airspace}\label{additional-time-in-terminal-airspace}}

The additional time in terminal airspace is calculated as the difference
of the actual flying time from entering the sequencing area (i.e.~100NM
radius around the airport) to the actual landing time. Previous research
and guidance suggests that reference time can be build for flights
sharing similar operational characteristics (entry sector, aircraft
class, and landing runway).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./06-efficiency_files/figure-pdf/fig-asma-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-asma}Additional time in terminal airspace}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-asma} compares the annual average of additional times in
terminal airspace across the study airports. On average, the arrival
flows at European airports are less constraint than in Brazil.

At London Heathrow (EGLL) a change in the operational concept helped to
reduce the excessive additional ASMA times observed pre-COVID. It must
be noted that the minimal results for both London airports (Heathrow and
Gatwick) in 2021 are a data artefact. The reference times for this study
are build on the basis of the performance observed in 2019. The lower
traffic levels resulted in more efficient and shorter terminal
sequencing operations. Compared to the 2019 reference times yields
therefore minimal additional times. Although there are improvements
across the operations at European airports in comparison to 2019, it
appears that with higher demand, procedural aspects applied before the
pandmic are being reintroduced.

During the pandemic, Brazilian aviation authorities relieved regulations
for general aviation in the São Paulo Congonhas (SBSP) airport. As this
relief was still in force during the recovery in 2021 and 2022,
balancing demand was difficult and caused higher additional time as the
traffic increased back. For example, in May 2022, the lack of slots,
associated with the gradual increase in demand, impacted the operations
of Congonhas airport (SBSP). From June 2022, the need for slot for
General aviation returned in force, but in October operations were again
impacted by the amount of storms above expected for the season.

For future reports, the data for for the assessment of the additional
time in terminal airspace will be complemented for Brazil. This will
allow to better investigate the changes observed across the years.
\footnote{The assessment of the additional time in terminal airspace for
  Brazil is based on a data set starting in 2021. This may also result
  in reasonable small reference times and increase the measured values
  for Brazil. With a complemented dataset and a change of the base year
  for future reports, these data phenomena will be addressed.}

Figure~\ref{fig-asma-vs-traffic-volume} depicts the change in terms of
the average additional time in terminal airspace comparing 2019 and
2022. It must be noted that with respect to traffic, the Brazilian data
set does not comprise all arriving traffic (c.f. traffic figures
reported in earlier chapters).

The comparison shows the effect of the decline of air traffic on the
performance in the European region. The contraction of demand resulted
in lower observed additional times accrued by the arriving traffic. For
some airports in the Brazil region it can be observed how procedural
aspects influence the additional time in terminal airspace. For example,
despite the variation of the traffic levels considered, the additional
time remained fairly stable at SBGR comparing pre- and post-pandemic
years.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-4}}

Operational efficiency provides an insight in terms of available benefit
pools that can be exploited. In light of the ongoing climate change
discussion, improvements in operational efficiency are directly linked
with the aircraft flying time and can help to reduce unnecessary
emissions.

Comparing the surface movement performance in Brazil and Europe shows
similar trends. On average, taxi-in operations are less constraint than
taxi-out movements. The latter observed higher additional times. This
may be subject to deconfliction of the traffic during the taxi-out
phase, the establishment of the departure sequence, and holding at/close
to the runway to maximise the runway utilisation.

The analysis of the additional time in terminal airspace on the basis of
the new data set for Brazil confirmed previous trends. On average,
arrival sequencing in combination with the lower capacity result in
higher additional times within the terminal airspace. It must be noted
that Brazil undertook a major airspace redesign project in 2021 that
influences the interface between the terminal airspace and the enroute
network. In the European region, the reduced level of air traffic
resulted in lower pressure on the sequencing of arrivals. However, the
step increase between 2021 and 2022 for several airports suggests that
constraints and more sequencing may come back with the increasing
demand.

It will be interesting to study in future iterations of this comparison
report to what extent arrival managment concepts deployed in the
different regions contribute to the observed additional times.

\chapter{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

This third edition of the Brazil-Europe operational ANS performance
comparison report builds on the joint project between the Performance
Section of DECEA and the Performance Review Unit of EUROCONTROL. The
collaboration aims at fostering the understanding and support the
further development of approaches to measure operational performance in
both regions. This report builds on a subset of indicators and metrics
established under the umbrella of ICAO's Global Air Navigation Plan
(ICAO 2019b). The work is also used to showcase the application of the
GANP indicators within a bi-regional and multi-regional project. DECEA
and EUROCONTROL engage actively within the international community and
share their findings of the bi-regional work. This iteration also
comprised the integration of additional data sources on the Brazilian
side. The new data sources offer to perform more fine-grained analyses
of the observed operational efficiency performance. This will allow to
further develop and complement the framework. The report also identified
several observations and ideas for future research which pave the way
ahead for augmenting the associated set of comparison analyses.

This report kicked off by examining the commonalities and differences in
terms of the organisation of air navigation services in both regions.
This was complemented by investigating the air traffic demand to better
understand the factors influencing operational performance. The air
navigation service provision is less fragmented in Brazil than in
Europe. This plays out in the total number of air traffic service units.
Both regions operate a central flow management function to ensure
network wide flow management.

In terms of air traffic demand, both regions were impacted by the
unprecedented decline of air traffic. Regional and global traffic
restrictions resulted in different patterns. The recovery in Brazil
followed a more continual path, while Europe experienced setbacks due to
the variety of national and pan-European measures deployed to curb the
spread of COVID. In 2022, the Brazilian system serviced more traffic
than pre-pandemic. In terms of traffic volume, Europe is still lagging
behind with about 85-90\% of pre-pandemic network level traffic in 2022.
The traffic situation is also reflected by the demand at the study
airports. There is also a higher level of diversity in terms of air
traffic evidenced by the share of light types serviced at the comparison
airports. International traffic is more centralised in Brazil than in
Europe.

The observed punctuality in both regions was strongly influenced by the
prevailing COVID-19 recovery. Particularly, Europe suffered strongly
from the surge of air traffic demand in early 2022 which is evidenced by
the high share of departure delays. The reactionary knock-on effect
amplified further the overall punctuality performance.

The utilisation of available runway system capacities is a fundamental
enabler for high levels of operational performance. This report showed
that associated capacities are commensurate with the current traffic
levels. For the majority of airports, the realised throughput ranges
still below the maximum declared capacities.

Operational efficiency is measured in this report in the form of the
additional time during the surface movement phases and the terminal
arrival phase. On average, taxi-in operations are less constrained than
taxi-out operations. The observed performance varies across the airports
and timeframe. In terms of arrival management, air traffic in Brazil
observed higher additional times in the terminal airspace. This report
showed that the scale effect of lower air traffic are potentially masked
by the effects of airspace redesign in Brazil. In the European region,
it appears that the higher level of air traffic demand puts pressure on
the arrival management and sequencing, and 2022 marks a return to higher
additional times within the terminal airspace. Further research can help
to identify drivers and performance enablers.

This third edition of the bi-regional comparison report documents the
continued technical collaboration between DECEA and EUROCONTROL. The
joint work also helped to promote the approach and state-of-the-art with
the international community. Both groups are contributing to the ICAO
GANP Performance Expert Group and the multi-national Performance
Benchmarking Working Group. The wider harmonisation of performance
related data and joint refinement of the guidance material and
application of the performance framework start paying dividends. For
example, PBWG concluded in its most recent meeting to collaborate on
topics of mutual interest for which this report supported the initial
research and validation.

A further outcome of the project is the close technical collaboration.
It is planned to augment the report and its future editions with a
rolling web-based monitoring, including regular updates of the
underlying data. This and future reports will help to complement the
time series of the measures tracked.
