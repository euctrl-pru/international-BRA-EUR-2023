**A continuing partnership**

This third edition of the bi-regional Brazil-Europe comparison report of Air Navigation System Performance continues to add transparent and robust data to support an informed discussion about operational performance in both regions.
Further, it strengthens the close collaboration between DECEA and EUROCONTROL.
This report is jointly developed by the Performance Section of the Department of Airspace Control (DECEA) and EUROCONTROL's Performance Review Unit (PRU).

For any questions, please do not hesitate to contact one of the authoring organisations.
